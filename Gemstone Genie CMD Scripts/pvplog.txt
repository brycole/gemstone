> l ervo
You see Ervo, a Halfling.
Ervo has a round face, almond-shaped ale-brown eyes and a crushed small nose.  He has cropped black hair, with dark brown skin and an athletic build.
He is a bit over average height for a Halfling.
He appears to be young.
He has a short scruffy mustache on his upper lip and a short rough beard.

He appears to be dying!  Other than that...

He looks fatigued.

He has a ghastly bloated head with bleeding from the ears compounded by a crushed skull with horrendous wounds, severely swollen and bruised chest area compounded by deep cuts across the chest area, complete paralysis of the entire body.

He is bleeding with discoloration in the chest, lightly from the chest, with widespread discoloration in the head and severely from the head.

He is wearing a chain helm, a rich crimson cloak branded with a simple beach scene, a rosewood longbow, a lever-drawn light crossbow, a sturdy backpack, a fuligin silk kimono with gracefully trailing sleeves, a chain shirt, a target shield, some mail gloves, a grey cambrinth ring, an albredine crystal ring, a leather sheath, a lockpick ring, some scarlet pantaloons, some chain greaves, a tiger-embossed bronze quiver and some knee-high deerskin boots.
> 
Zehira begins to focus intently on Ervo.
> 
You notice as a blue-tongued turtle pulls its head into its shell for a moment.
> 
Blood suddenly flies up from Ervo's abdomen as thick, violent slashes carve up and down it.  Gibbets of flesh are joined by chips of bone as organs designed never to see the light of day begin to be revealed.
Ervo is knocked completely senseless!
> 
Your shadow babbles, "Na na bo mageemoleelibo!"
> 
 * Ervo is slain before your eyes!
