ECHO **************************************************************************
ECHO * Usage For:
ECHO * Stunman With Masters: - .guildx # <current_skill> -
ECHO * 	<current_skill> = shield, get, stand, stance1, etc..
ECHO *	The skill MUST be spelled out comletely!
ECHO *	For the 6th skill it will be a bit different. I've added
ECHO *	instructions that you will see if you have to do the 6th skill.
ECHO * Stunman Self Reps: - .guildx - Unless otherwise noted
ECHO *	I only have it to use with skull or rum. Searches for rum first
ECHO *	If using a skull the base pause RT is 12 seconds, however
ECHO *	If you type (.guildx 4 x x x )(needs 4 variables)
ECHO *	 you will switch to 13 seconds.
ECHO *	Depending on lag, one might work better than the other.
ECHO * Stunman arrow/slap: usage - .guildx # x x - depending on pattern
ECHO *	Example of Landing guild work:
ECHO *	  For pattern 1 type .guildx # #
ECHO *	  For pattern 2 type .guildx # # x
ECHO *	  For pattern 3 type .guildx # # x x
ECHO *	  For pattern 4 type .guildx # # x x x
ECHO * This will allow you to try different patterns for SLAP and ARROWS
ECHO * Currently I have 4 patterns for SLAP and 2 for ARROWS
ECHO * I might add another pattern for arrows soon too.
ECHO * The script can be restarted while working with the masters.
ECHO * Restart command is same as first start command.
